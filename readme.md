NODE.JS CRASH COURSE
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32M1al-Y6Ag

Node.js is an open-source JS runtime 
Uses V8 JS engine that Google Chrome uses
Used for server-side and network apps/apis
Takes JS out of the browser
Fast, scalable, and popular 

Agenda:
How Node.js works
-build on v8 JS engine
-non-blocking - doesn't wait for i/o operations
-single threaded - instructions to execute - only one is executed at a time
-event loop - form non-blocking modules - executes the callbacks
-node is used for APIs, server-rendered apps, real-time apps, microservices, command line tools, bots, web scraping, web servers.
-node is not good for CPU-intensive tasks

HTTP Basics (methods, status codes, etc)
How JSON APIs works
